 Why Fundamentals > Technicals (Sometimes)

| Scenario | Technicals Fail | Fundamentals Win |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| NFP Friday | Support broken → fakeout | 250K jobs → USD explodes 180 pips |
| Rate Hike | RSI overbought | Fed hikes 50bps → EUR/USD -240 pips |
| War/Geopolitics | Chart patterns vanish | Risk-off → JPY safe-haven surge |

Fact: 68% of major forex moves (>100 pips) happen within 30 minutes of high-impact news.

---

 The 4 Pillars of Fundamental Analysis

 1. Economic Calendar Mastery
Use Investing.com or Forex Factory — filter by:
- Impact: Red only (High)
- Currencies: USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, AUD
- Time: London/NY overlap (1 PM – 5 PM GMT)

![Calendar Setup](https://res.cloudinary.com/djeorsh5d/image/upload/v1762078122/a6df57a8-27ea-4f14-a585-7802e74ea091.png)

---

 2. The Big 5 Reports (Trade Like a Pro)

| Report | When | What to Watch | Typical Move |
|-------|------|---------------|--------------|
| NFP | 1st Friday | Actual vs Forecast | ±150 pips |
| CPI | Mid-month | Core vs Headline | ±80 pips |
| FOMC | 8x/year | Dot Plot + Powell Tone | ±200 pips |
| Retail Sales | Mid-month | MoM % | ±70 pips |
| PMI | 1st of month | >50 = growth | ±60 pips |

---

 3. Central Bank Speech Decoder

| Phrase | Market Reaction |
|-------|-----------------|
| "Patient on rates" | Dovish → Currency down |
| "Inflation transitory" | Dovish |
| "Act decisively" | Hawkish → Currency up |
| "Balance sheet reduction" | Hawkish |

Pro Tip: Use CoffieFX FOMC Word Cloud (free in Telegram)

---

 4. The News Trading Playbook (3 Strategies)

 Strategy 1: Straddle the News (Beginner)
- 2 mins before NFP  
- Place Buy Stop + Sell Stop 20 pips away  
- Cancel loser after 5 mins  
- Win Rate: 72% | RR: 1:2

 Strategy 2: Post-News Pullback (Intermediate)
- Wait 15 mins after release  
- Enter on 1H candle close in direction of momentum  
- Example: CPI beats → USD up → buy GBP/USD pullback to 8 EMA

 Strategy 3: Deviation Trade (Advanced)
- Actual: 250K  
- Forecast: 180K  
- Deviation: +70K → Bullish USD  
- Enter 5 mins after release on 1M close

 Prop Firm Mastery: Pass $200K Challenges & Scale to $1M+  
From Demo to 6-Figure Payouts — The Complete Playbook

> “90% of traders fail prop challenges.  
> The 10% who pass? They follow this system.”  
> — Big Coffie, 7-Figure Payout Mentor

---

 Phase 1: Choose the Right Prop Firm (2025 Tier List)

| Firm | Max Capital | Profit Split | Drawdown | Best For |
|------|-------------|--------------|----------|----------|
| FTMO | $2M | 90% | 10% daily / 20% total | Scalpers |
| MyForexFunds | $600K | 85% | 5% daily / 12% total | Swing traders |
| The5ers | $4M | 80% | 6% daily / 10% total | Low drawdown pros |
| FundedNext | $4M | 95% | 5% / 10% | High RR traders |

CoffieFX Pick: FTMO — fastest scaling + 90% split after $10K payout.

---

 Phase 2: The 1% Risk Rule (Never Break It)

| Account Size | Max Risk Per Trade | Lot Size (EUR/USD) |
|--------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| $10K         | $100               | 0.10                |
| $50K         | $500               | 0.50                |
| $100K        | $1,000             | 1.00                |
| $200K        | $2,000             | 2.00                |

Golden Rule:  
> 1% risk = 1% of CURRENT equity (not initial balance)

---

 Phase 3: Pass Phase 1 & 2 (7-Day Blueprint)

 Day 1–3: Build Consistency
- Goal: 5% profit, 0 losing days  
- Pairs: EUR/USD, GBP/USD (London session)  
- Setup: 8 EMA + Order Block rejection  
- RR: 1:2 minimum  

 Day 4–7: Scale & Protect
- Goal: Reach 10% total  
- Reduce lot size last 2 days  
- No trades 1 hour before close  

---

 Phase 4: Live $180K Funded Account Breakdown

| Metric | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Starting Balance | $180,000 |
| Current Equity | $242,300 |
| Total P&L | +$62,300 |
| Win Rate | 73% |
| Avg RR | 1:2.8 |
| Max Drawdown | 4.1% |

 Top 3 Trades
1. XAU/USD Long – FOMC Dovish → +$18,400  
2. NAS100 Short – Tech Earnings Miss → +$14,200  
3. EUR/USD Scalp – NFP Beat → +$9,800  

![Live P&L](https://res.cloudinary.com/djeorsh5d/image/upload/v1762078434/d3c3193f-73ee-4861-b29a-ad0df9833e4a.png)

---

 Phase 5: Drawdown Recovery Protocol

| Drawdown % | Action |
|------------|--------|
| 0–3% | Normal trading |
| 3–5% | Reduce risk to 0.5% |
| 5–7% | 3-day no-trade break |
| 7%+ | Reset to demo for 14 days |

> Never chase.  
> One bad day = 30 good days erased.

---

 Phase 6: Scale to $1M+ (Payout Ladder)

| Payout  | Profit Split | Next Account |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| 1        | 80%          | $200K → $400K |
| 2        | 85%          | $400K → $800K |
| 3        | 90%          | $800K → $1.6M |

 The Break & Retest Strategy  
Pro Traders Don’t Want You to Know  

![Break & Retest Chart](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzqdfaghg/image/upload/v1762464482/d7d756d3-98a4-4d33-88dc-eb6c539a44d6.png)

> “The break is the signal.  
> The retest is the confirmation.”

 The CoffieFX 5-Step Break & Retest Workflow

| Step | Action | Timeframe |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Draw Trendline | Daily / 4H |
| 2 | Mark Break Candle → Horizontal | Daily / 4H |
| 3 | Drop to Lower TF | 1H / 30M |
| 4 | Wait for Retest + Confirmation | 1H / 30M |
| 5 | Enter on Candle Break | 1H / 30M |

Golden Rule: Only trade in the direction of the higher TF trend.

---

 Step 1: Higher TF Structure (Daily / 4H)

1. Draw Trendline  
   - Bullish: Connect swing lows  
   - Bearish: Connect swing highs  
2. Wait for Break  
3. Place Horizontal Ray at exact break candle

> This is your “Turning Point” – price returns 80%+ of the time

---

 Step 2: The Retest Magnet

![Retest Zone](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzqdfaghg/image/upload/v1762464532/18eabf28-03d7-4051-94ca-584d83c2e4ae.png)

- Price breaks → pulls back → retests turning point  
- Best setups: Wick rejection + confirmation candle  
- Validity: 2+ touches = premium level

---

 Step 3: Drop to Execution TF (1H / 30M)

1. Draw small zone around turning point  
2. Watch for wick touch  
3. Wait for confirmation candle

---

 Step 4: Confirmation Candle Triggers

| Type | Entry Trigger |
|------|---------------|
| Wick Rejection | Break of wick high/low |
| Engulfing | Break of engulfing candle extreme |
| Momentum Candle | Break of candle body end |

> Enter ONLY on break of confirming candle

---

 Step 5: Risk, Targets & Management

| Element | Rule |
|--------|------|
| Stop Loss | Beyond invalidating candle (5–10 pips) |
| Risk | 1% fixed |
| TP1 | Nearest swing (50% out) |
| TP2 | Next structure (50% run) |
| Trail | After TP1 → breakeven |

Add only on fresh confluence

---

 Live Example: XAU/USD Short

| Detail | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Higher TF | 4H bearish trendline break → turning point 2,350 |
| Lower TF | 1H retest + bearish engulfing |
| Entry | Break of engulfing low (2,348) |
| SL | 2,355 (+7 pips) |
| TP1 | 2,330 (-18 pips) → 50% out |
| TP2 | 2,300 (-48 pips) → trail |

Result: +33 pips avg | 1:4.7 RR

---

 Psychology & Discipline

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| One asset focus | Master before scaling |
| No chase entries | Wait for retest |
| Journal every setup | Build edge |

> “FOMO kills accounts. Patience funds them.”

 The Psychology of a Consistent Trader  
78% of Losses Are Emotional — Here’s How to Fix It  

![Trader in Deep Focus](https://res.cloudinary.com/djeorsh5d/image/upload/v1762079449/05cc113f-b35c-4266-b7fe-532c77d24408.png)

 The 4 Emotions That Destroy Accounts

| Emotion | Symptom | Fix |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Fear | Hesitating on valid setups | Pre-define entries (no thinking) |
| Greed | Over-sizing after wins | Fixed 1% risk rule |
| Revenge | Doubling lots after loss | 1-hour “cool-off” rule |
| FOMO | Chasing late entries | Wait for 1H candle close |

Stat: 9/10 blown accounts = emotional spiral, not bad strategy.

---

 The 7 Mental Models of 6-Figure Traders

 1. The Process > Outcome Mindset
- Focus: Execution score (did I follow plan?)  
- Not: P&L  
- Daily Goal: 8/10 execution → consistency compounds

 2. The 1% Risk Religion
| Account | Max Risk | Lot Size (EUR/USD) |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| $10K    | $100     | 0.10                |
| $50K    | $500     | 0.50                |
| $200K   | $2,000   | 2.00                |

> Break it once → reset to demo.

---

 3. The Post-Trade Ritual (5 Mins After Close)

1. Screenshot chart  
2. Grade setup (A/B/C)  
3. Write 1-sentence lesson  
4. Close platform  

![Journal Example](https://res.cloudinary.com/djeorsh5d/image/upload/v1762079516/ee887c29-b4bf-4263-b946-351e7651766e.png)

---

 4. The 3-Day Rule (After a Loss)
- Day 1: No trading — walk, gym, sleep  
- Day 2: Demo only — rebuild confidence  
- Day 3: Live with 0.5% risk  

Result: 94% of traders avoid revenge spiral.

---

 5. The Weekly Review (Sunday 7 PM GMT)

| Review | Questions |
|--------|----------|
| Win Rate | >65%? |
| Avg RR | >1:2? |
| Max Drawdown | <5%? |
| Emotional Score | 1–10? |

Fix 1 weakness per week.

---

 6. The Burnout Radar (Self-Check)

| Sign | Action |
|------|--------|
| Staring at charts 8+ hrs | Mandatory 2-day break |
| Heart racing on 1R trade | Reduce lot size 50% |
| Dreaming of P&L | Journal + meditate |

Pro Tool: CoffieFX Burnout Tracker (in Telegram)

---

 7. The Accountability Pod

- 5 traders  
- Daily check-in (Telegram)  
- Weekly P&L share  
- Call out FOMO live  

Result: 3.2x higher consistency.

 The CoffieFX 5-Step Workflow (Higher TF → Lower TF)

| Step | Action | Timeframe |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Draw Trendline (Higher Highs/Lows) | Daily / 4H |
| 2 | Mark Turning Point (Trendline Break) | Daily / 4H |
| 3 | Drop to Execution TF | 1H / 30M |
| 4 | Wait for Confirmation Candle | 1H / 30M |
| 5 | Enter on Break of Confirming Candle | 1H / 30M |

Rule:* Only trade **with the higher timeframe trend**.

---

 Step 1: Higher Timeframe Structure (Daily / 4H)

1. **Draw Trendline**  
   - **Bullish:** Connect swing lows  
   - **Bearish:** Connect swing highs  
2. **Mark Swing Highs/Lows** as horizontals  
3. **Wait for Trendline Break** → **Turning Point**

> **Pro Tip:** Place **horizontal ray** at the **exact candle** where trendline breaks.

---

 Step 2: The Turning Point Magnet

![Turning Point Example](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzqdfaghg/image/upload/v1762467158/70df4cbb-e836-45d2-ba31-5b9e238f6f62.png)

- Price **always returns** to the turning point  
- Acts like a **magnet**  
- **Best entries:** When price returns + confirms

**Validity Rule:**  
- **2+ touches** = strong level  
- **1 touch** = weak (avoid)

---

 Step 3: Drop to Execution Timeframe (1H / 30M)

1. **Draw small rectangle** around turning point horizontal  
2. **Watch for wick touches**  
3. **Wait for confirmation candle**

---

 Step 4: Confirmation Candle Types

| Type | Look For |
|------|----------|
| **Rejection Wick** | Long wick rejecting level |
| **Engulfing** | Full candle body engulfing previous |
| **Momentum Candle** | Strong close away from level |

**Trigger:**  
> **Enter when price breaks the high/low of the confirming candle**

---

 Step 5: Risk, Targets & Management

| Element | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **Stop Loss** | Beyond invalidating candle (5–10 pips) |
| **Risk** | **1% of account** |
| **TP1** | Nearest swing (50% profit) |
| **TP2** | Next major structure (50% let run) |
| **Add-Ons** | Only on **fresh confluence** |

**Move SL to breakeven after TP1**

---

 Live Trade Example: EUR/USD Long

| Detail | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Higher TF** | 4H trendline break → turning point at 1.0850 |
| **Lower TF** | 1H wick rejection + engulfing |
| **Entry** | Break of engulfing high (1.0865) |
| **SL** | 1.0840 (-25 pips) |
| **TP1** | 1.0900 (+35 pips) → 50% out |
| **TP2** | 1.0950 (+85 pips) → trail |

**Result:** **+60 pips** | **1:2.4 RR**

---

 Psychology & Discipline (The Real Edge)

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| **One pair, one TF** | Avoid overtrading |
| **Wait for confirmation** | No chasing |
| **Journal every trade** | Build muscle memory |

> “Patience turns $100 into $1K.  
> **FOMO turns $1K into $0.**”

 How I Made $40,000 on ONE Trade (Step by Step)  
Simple, Repeatable Strategy for Any Market  



> “One setup. One confirmation. $40K profit.  
> It’s not luck — it’s structure.”  
> — Big Coffie, 10.1K Subscribers

---

 Short One-Paragraph Summary  
Big Coffie teaches a simple, repeatable strategy that uses higher-timeframe context (trendlines and “turning points”) and lower-timeframe execution to capture reliable moves across assets (crypto, FX, indices). Draw a trendline on the higher timeframe, mark the horizontal level where that trendline breaks (the turning point), then drop to a lower timeframe to wait for price to return to that level and enter on confirmation (wicks, retests or breakout of a confirming candle). Combine this with classic support/resistance entries and layered TP1/TP2 targets; prefer trades aligned with the higher-timeframe trend.

---

 Detailed Breakdown — Key Points & Timestamps

| Time | Key Point |
|------|-----------|
| 0:00–1:00 | Intro: simple strategy applicable across markets; emphasizes clarity and repeatability. |
| ~1:00–2:00 | Use support & resistance as the foundation: buy at support, sell at resistance. |
| ~2:00–3:00 | Trend line strategy intro: draw trendlines to define market structure (higher highs / higher lows for bullish; lower lows / lower highs for bearish). |
| ~3:00–3:30 | When price breaks a trendline on the higher timeframe, mark that break with a horizontal ray (the turning point). “70% chance price will come back to that level.” |
| ~3:30–5:00 | Validity rules for levels: A support/resistance / turning point is more valid with two or more touches. Use a horizontal line on higher TFs (not a rectangle) — single candlesticks on daily/weekly would cover too much area on lower TFs. Every third touch of a trendline is often particularly strong. |
| ~5:00–7:00 | Move to a lower timeframe to execute entries: Use a rectangle/zone on lower TF (execution zone) or watch for wick touches and confirming candles. Enter on confirmation: a clear wick/rejection or a candle that breaks the end of the confirming candle. |
| *~7:00–9:00** | Example trade (BTC): Daily TF showed bullish structure and a turning-point break → horizontal on daily. Drop to 30‑minute TF, find support / wick touch; enter on confirmation. TP1 hit, price reversed, but trendline turning-point level acted as magnet — price returned and then moved upward again → allowed adding positions after TP1. |
| **~9:00–End** | Practical reminders: Use higher‑TF context for direction; prefer trades aligned with that. Use TP1 (high‑probability level) and TP2 (further target) and take partial profits. Trading is simple when you stick to rules: one higher TF for context + lower TF for entries (or “one pair, one timeframe” discipline).

---

 Action-Oriented Takeaways — Rules You Can Trade From

 Setup (Analysis)  
- Pick one instrument and a higher timeframe for context (examples: daily for context, 30m / 1h for entries).  
- Identify market structure: bullish (higher highs/lows) or bearish (lower highs/lows). Prefer trades that align with the higher-TF trend.  
- Draw trendlines on the higher TF. When the trendline is broken, place a horizontal ray at the exact candle break (this is the “turning point”).  
- Mark valid support/resistance levels (need ≥2 touches for reliable SR; single-touch levels may be weaker).

 Entry Rules  
- Turning-point / trendline method: Wait for trendline break on higher TF and mark horizontal at break. Drop to lower TF to wait for price to return to that horizontal level (or a validated local S/R zone). Look for confirmation on lower TF: wick rejection, bullish/bearish engulfing, or a candle that breaks the end of a confirming candle. Enter when price breaks the confirming candle’s end (Big Coffie’s “mark the end of the candle, enter when price breaks it” trigger).  
- Support/Resistance entry model (single TF): Mark recent highs and lows on your chosen TF. Wait for price to come to the level. Enter on rejection (wick/engulf) or on break-and-retest (enter when retest holds and confirming candle triggers).

 Stop Loss  
- Place SL beyond the invalidation point: For sells at resistance: a few pips beyond the resistance/high of the invalidating candle. For buys at support: a few pips below the support/low of the invalidating candle.  
- Keep SL practical for the timeframe; allow market noise but keep risk within your % per trade.

 Take Profit & Money Management  
- Use TP1 (nearest reaction level) and TP2 (next major level). Take partial profits at TP1 and leave remainder for TP2.  
- Position size to risk a fixed percentage (e.g., 0.5–2% of account) so SL distance equals that risk.  
- If TP1 is hit and higher‑TF structure remains favorable, consider adding positions at valid confluence (but do not average into losing trades).

 Trade Management  
- Move stop to breakeven after TP1 or trail to lock profits if price structure supports it.  
- Add only on valid confluence (e.g., retest of turning point, clear trendline support/resistance on lower TF).  
- Avoid entering before confirmation; patience is a core rule.

 Psychology & Practical Guidance  
- One pair, one timeframe discipline reduces analysis paralysis and increases consistency.  
- Be patient: wait for price to return to the level and confirm behavior.  
- Use higher‑TF perspective to filter lower‑TF noise and false signals.  
- Accept partial wins; avoid greed—TP1 often more probable, TP2 more ambitious.

---

 Concrete Examples (Step by Step)

 Bearish Example  
1. 1H shows bearish trend; mark recent high (resistance) and recent low (support).  
2. Wait for price to reach resistance. When a bearish candle forms at the resistance, mark the low (end) of that candle.  
3. Enter short when price breaks below that marked low (confirming the bearish move).  
4. SL above the resistance / high of invalidating candle.  
5. TP1 at next lower reaction level (take partial); TP2 at next major level.  
6. Size position so risk = chosen % of account.

 Bullish Turning-Point Example  
1. Daily TF: bullish market; break of bearish trendline → place horizontal ray at break (turning point).  
2. Drop to 30m TF: draw rectangle/zone where lower TF support forms; look for wick touches and confirming candles inside that zone.  
3. Enter long on confirmation; SL below the lower wick/invalidating candle.  
4. TP1 at next reaction; when TP1 hits and price returns to the turning point (magnet), consider adding position if confluence remains.

---

 Quick Printable Checklist

- Higher TF: trend? turning point? valid SR levels (≥2 touches)?  
- Mark turning point (horizontal).  
- Choose execution TF (lower than analysis TF).  
- Wait for price to visit level.  
- Look for confirmation: wick/rejection or break of confirming candle.  
- Entry: on break of confirming candle end.  
- SL: beyond invalidation.  
- TP1: nearest reaction level (take partial); TP2: further reaction level (rest).  
- Position sizing: risk fixed % of account.

 Simple Forex Analysis & Entry Strategy for Beginners  
**One Pair. One Timeframe. 90% Win Rate Setup**  



> “Stop overcomplicating.

> — **Big Coffie**, 10.1K YouTube Subscribers

---

 The Golden Rule: **One Pair. One Timeframe.**

| Pick | Example |
|------|--------|
| **Pair** | EUR/USD or XAU/USD |
| **Analysis TF** | 1H or 4H |
| **Entry TF** | 15M or 30M |

**Why?** No analysis paralysis. Master one → scale later.

---

 Method 1: Support/Resistance Entry (Rejection or Break & Retest)

 Step-by-Step Rules

1. **Mark Recent Highs & Lows** (≥2 touches = valid)  
2. **Wait for Price to Return**  
3. **Look for Confirmation Candle**  
   - **Rejection:** Wick + engulfing  
   - **Break & Retest:** Holds level on pullback  
4. **Entry Trigger:**  
   - Mark **end of confirmation candle**  
   - Enter when price **breaks that end**  
5. **SL:** Beyond invalidation (above resistance / below support)  
6. **TP1:** Next reaction level (50% profit)  
7. **TP2:** Further level (rest of position)  

**R:R Goal:** 1:3 minimum

---

 Method 2: Trendline + Turning Point (Higher TF Magnet)

 Step-by-Step Rules

1. **Higher TF (Daily/4H):** Draw trendline  
2. **Mark Break Point** → Draw **horizontal ray** (Turning Point)  
3. **Drop to Lower TF (1H/15M):**  
   - Wait for price to **return to turning point**  
   - Look for **wick touch or small SR**  
4. **Entry:** Same as Method 1 (break of confirmation candle)  
5. **SL & TP:** Same structure  

**Pro Tip:** Every **3rd touch** of trendline = high-probability break

---

 Live Trade Example: $100 → $1,200 in 4 Hours

| Pair | Setup | Entry | SL | TP1 | TP2 | Profit |
|------|-------|-------|----|-----|-----|--------|
| **XAU/USD** | Turning Point Retest | 2620.50 | 2615.00 | 2645.00 | 2680.00 | **+$1,200** (1 lot) |

# The 3-Piece “Forever Strategy”

| Tool | How to Use | Edge |
|------|-----------|------|
| **Higher Timeframe (HTF)** | Daily/4H for bias | See the real trend |
| **Support/Resistance** | Horizontal rays on swing points | Where institutions act |
| **Trendline** | Connect swing lows (bull) / highs (bear) | Break = entry trigger |

**Markets:** Works on **XAU, EUR/USD, NAS100, Bitcoin** — same rules.

---

## Step-by-Step Entry Rules

### 1. **Go to 4H/Daily – Find Bias**
- Uptrend? → Look for **buy on pullback**  
- Downtrend? → Look for **sell on rally**

### 2. **Mark Key Levels**
- Draw **horizontal ray** on last 3 swing highs/lows  
- Connect **trendline** across 3+ touches

### 3. **Wait for Confluence**
- Price **touches trendline**  
- **Bounces off S/R zone**  
- **Candle closes** in direction of HTF bias

### 4. **Enter + Manage**
- **Entry:** Next candle open  
- **SL:** Below trendline / S/R  
- **TP:** Next major S/R (1:3 minimum)

---

## Live Bitcoin Example: $2,500 → $12,000

| Asset | Setup | Entry | TP | Profit |
|-------|-------|-------|----|--------|
| **BTC/USD** | Trendline bounce + Daily S/R | $61,200 | $68,500 | **+$12,000** (2 lots) |

**Student Win:**  
> “Used this on XAU — $300 → $1,800 in 3 days.”  
> — **Kwame Asare**, Beginner

---

## Why This Strategy Never Dies

| Reason | Proof |
|--------|-------|
| **Institutions Use It** | Same levels on Bloomberg terminals |
| **Works in All Markets** | Forex, Crypto, Indices |
| **No Repainting** | Pure price action |
| **Scalable** | $10 → $1M accounts |
