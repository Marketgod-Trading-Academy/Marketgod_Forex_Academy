Let me tell you a little bit about MarketGold. His journey started when he was in University, where he was introduced to Forex. So at that time, he was trading forex but couldn't get clarity. So fast forward after completing University, he was stuck in a room always looking at the chart, trying to find his way on the chart. At that moment, he sometimes collect money from his mother to trade which he always loses and there was pressure from the family that what are you doing inside, why are you always on your laptop, is this thing going to work and those kind of stuffs. But fast forward, he didn't give up and was always trying. And now, things has worked out and now he sometimes do tours to educate youngsters about forex trading. He has a partnership with SNS and many other things. So now he has an academy that he teaches other people. So that is kind of some brief of his life span on this earth.
