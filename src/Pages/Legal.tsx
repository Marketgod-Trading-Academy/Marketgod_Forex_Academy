            <p>
              Trading foreign exchange (Forex), cryptocurrencies, and contracts for differences (CFDs) on margin carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to trade any such leveraged products, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Possibility of Loss:</strong> The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading on margin and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.
            </p>
            <p>
